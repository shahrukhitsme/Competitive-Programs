Moore voting element

It is an algorithm which finds the majority element in an array in
O(n) time and
O(1) space.
A majority element is the element whose occurence is more that n/2, where n is the size of the array.

Step 1: Finding candidate for Majority element
Step 2: Verifying and accepting or saying there is no majority element.

How to find the candidate:
Start traversing the array and keep 2 variables which track the current candidate and it's count.
Select first element as the candidate and set count to 1
Move forward, and increase count only when you see the candidate, and if count becomes 0, then change the candidate and set count to 1.
In this way, at the last only that element will be the candidate which is in majority, if there is any.
