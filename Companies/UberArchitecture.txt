Feature: scheduling meetings
	   Invitation
	   Account

A data structure which can store the meetings across 24 hrs.

Array having 24 * 4 = 96 slots signifying 15 mins slot.
It is to store the availability of a person.

To check conflict, we will have to check all the slots, in the time period, I am querying for.

P1 meetings = [ 0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,...];
P2 meetings = [ 0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,...];
P3 meetings = [ 0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,...];
1 means that 15 mins slot is occupied for that person and 0 means it is not.
If we do an OR operation across all schedules, we will get the slots free for all the people.
Complexity is O(n)

For better memory usage, can store after converting to decimal in the database.

For UI, I would use something like React, beause it would mainly be a single page application, only part of the application would require re rendering, and there will be a lot of re usable components in the calendar.
